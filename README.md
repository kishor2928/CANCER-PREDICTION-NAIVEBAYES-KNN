# CANCER-PREDICTION-NAIVEBAYES-KNN

This project is focused on predicting cancer levels through the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers. The dataset utilized for this project contains a variety of features that are pertinent to patients' characteristics, including age, smoking habits, and instances of chest pain. The target variable in this dataset indicates the level of cancer, categorized as either high or low.

The first phase of the project involves comprehensive data preprocessing. This crucial step includes handling any missing values to ensure the dataset's integrity, as well as encoding categorical variables to make them suitable for analysis by machine learning algorithms. Proper preprocessing is essential for improving the accuracy of the predictive models.

Following the preprocessing, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. This split is vital for the model training process, allowing for the evaluation of how well the models can predict cancer levels on unseen data. Both KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers are then applied to the training data to develop predictive models.
